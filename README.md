<h1>Weather Dashboard</h1>
<br>
This Application provides the current weather of the user's specified city-name search input, as well as a five day forecast which includes temperature, humidity, and the UV index. This data is called upon using Open Weathers API's. The last five location searches are stored in your local storage, and are accesible with a re-click of the city-name via the search-history list. The UV index is color coordinated with the conditions of the weather.
